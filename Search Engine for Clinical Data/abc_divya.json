Therefore, prevention of metastases after\n      early disease is of utmost importance. Extensive studies of the Wnt signal cascade have\n      elucidated its role in colorectal cancer development and proliferation. Several well-known\n      targets of the Wnt-cascade, like DKK1, APCDD1 and AXIN2, serve as feedback inhibitors and\n      likely prevent pathway hyperactivation. Therefore, loss of these control mechanisms, for\n      example due to repression of Wnt targets by CpG island methylation, serves as a potent\n      proliferative signal. Recently, we identified a subset of colon cancers that are typified by\n      CpG island methylation of specific Wnt target genes and have a poor prognosis.

Currently colon cancer screening is\n      recommended at the age of 50 years old for all patients who are at average risk. Colonoscopy\n      is considered the gold standard test for colon cancer screening. This is partly because\n      colonoscopy not only can detect polyps which are cancer precursors but also can remove them,\n      and thereby detecting cancer and its precursors and preventing cancer. Unfortunately recent\n      data suggest that colonoscopy can miss a significant percentage of polyps, especially on the\n      right side of the colon. It is thought that one of the major reasons for missing polyps in\n      the right side of the colon is the fact that they are flat or sessile serrated adenoma, both\n      of which are more difficult than protruding polyps to identify with ordinary colon\n      preparation and colonoscopes. Chromoendoscopy is the application of dye during colonoscopy\n      to enhance detection of polyps. It has been shown that it improves the detection of polyps\n      and thus has the potential of improving the performance of colonoscopy and increasing the\n      detection of these difficult to detect polyps. It is however cumbersome and time consuming,\n      which has discouraged its use. Indigo carmine, one commonly used dye, is actually FDA\n      approved as a food colorant and can be consumed orally. It is minimally absorbed.

To date, surgical resection remains the mainstay\n      of treatment for colon cancer. However, between 35% and 45% of patients, despite colon\n      surgery, retain unseen tumor cells in the bloodstream or in small clumps in the liver or\n      other tissues. It is for this reason that postoperative chemotherapy (anti-tumor drugs) is\n      recommended and given to some patients after surgery. Conventional chemotherapy is usually\n      started no earlier than 4 to 6 weeks after the colon cancer has been resected.\n\n      Despite surgery and conventional chemotherapy, a significant number of patients develop\n      cancer recurrences and many go on to die from the cancer. For this reason, investigators\n      continue to look for new cancer treatments and approaches. The study under consideration\n      proposes to give colon cancer patients an anti-cancer therapy for 3 weeks before and for 3\n      weeks after undergoing operation to remove the colon cancer. This time period is referred to\n      as the \"perioperative period.\" Presently, around the world, doctors do not administer any\n      type of anti-cancer therapy during the perioperative period. It is the belief of the\n      investigators carrying out this study that this period may be an ideal time to fight the\n      tumor and that treatment given during this time may improve survival and reduce cancer\n      recurrence rates. Patients who choose to receive this biologic anti-cancer treatment\n      immediately before and after surgery can also receive conventional chemotherapy at the usual\n      time (4-6 weeks after surgery). Thus, this perioperative anti-cancer treatment would not\n      interfere with the standard chemotherapy regimens used today.\n\n      The drug that is to be given in this study is called Cetuximab (also known as \"Erbitux\").\n      This is an anti-cancer drug which has already been approved by the FDA for use in patients\n      who have colon cancer. This drug, like all of the other anti-cancer drugs used for treating\n      colon cancer, has been given either well after surgery or to patients with very advanced\n      disease who have not undergo surgery. What is unique about the St. Luke's Roosevelt study is\n      that the drug will be given during the 3 weeks before surgery and for the first 3 weeks\n      after the colon resection surgery.\n\n      To summarize, Cetuximab is a humanized antibody to EGFR which has been shown to be effective\n      in killing tumor cells in patients with colon cancer.\n\n      In this study the Cetuximab is to be given 1) after the surgery, 2) immediately before the\n      operation, or 3) both before and after surgery. Entry into the study means that the\n      operation may be delayed for at least 3 weeks in order for the drug to be given. Since many\n      patients who do not participate in any research studies wait at least that long for surgery\n      this does not constitute a delay. The drug has a safety profile and has been well tolerated,\n      in general. However, since thus far it has not been given in the weeks immediately prior to\n      or immediately after major surgery there is no safety profile for this drug during the\n      perioperative period. The primary goals of this preliminary study are to establish the\n      safety of Cetuximab in the perioperative period and to demonstrate that the preoperative\n      doses have an actual impact on the tumor cells themselves.\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      Cetuximab's tumor growth inhibitory mechanism directly blocks EGFR. After binding to EGFR,\n      the antibody blocks signal transduction through the receptor with a subsequent inhibition of\n      tumor cell proliferation and MMP expression. We hypothesize that peri-operative weekly\n      administration of Cetuximab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to EGF receptor (EGFR), for 3\n      weeks immediately prior to surgery and for 3 weeks immediately after colon cancer surgery is\n      safe. This drug has been demonstrated to be effective in Stage 4 colon cancer patients and\n      is approved for use in colorectal cancer patients.

A compound found in the skin of grapes, resveratrol, has been purported to have colon\n      cancer prevention activity though the dosages obtained through the diet have always seemed\n      too low to produce inhibitory effects against cancer cells in the laboratory. We have found\n      that low concentrations of resveratrol inhibit the Wnt pathway, a key signaling pathway\n      which is activated in over 85% of colon cancers. We have also found in a small pilot trial\n      that low dosages of freeze-dried grape powder can directly inhibit Wnt signaling in the\n      normal colon and that grape powder was more effective than resveratrol alone in blocking Wnt\n      throughput. This suggests that components of grapes may have direct activity in inhibiting a\n      key signaling pathway and that this may correlate with cancer prevention activity.\n\n      In this study, we will directly test the impact of a diet containing a specific amount of\n      red grapes in the context of a controlled amount of other resveratrol containing foodstuffs\n      on Wnt signaling in the colon. This grape-supplemented diet provides a low-dose of\n      resveratrol in conjunction with other potentially active components contained within the\n      grapes. Participants will be normal volunteers and molecular studies will be done on colon\n      tissue obtained by a limited flexible sigmoidoscopy before, and after, the red\n      grape-containing diet is ingested. Different dosages of grapes will be utilized. This study\n      will define the effect of dietary grape-derived low dose resveratrol on biomarkers related\n      to the Wnt pathway, and provide critical information as to the utility of this nutritional\n      approach toward colon cancer prevention.\n\n      For this study, seedless red grapes will be used.

Currently colon cancer prevention is\n      achieved by endoscopic evaluation and removal of pre-malignant lesions (adenomatous polyps)\n      by endoscopic resection and biopsy. Standard endoscopy uses white light illumination and is\n      only able to detect pre-cancerous tissue that has abnormal architectural features, such as a\n      polyp or mass. However, pre-cancerous lesions can also be flat in appearance and visually\n      indistinct from normal tissue; such as in the case of chronic ulcerative colitis and / or\n      some right-sided polyps.\n\n      Furthermore, flat and depressed lesions, which are more difficult to detect in white light\n      colonoscopy, may represent over 25% of all pre-malignant lesions and may confer a higher\n      risk for malignancy. Integration of molecular probes that home in to diseased tissues with\n      high resolution imaging instruments could greatly improve the diagnostic accuracy for missed\n      lesions of both polypoid and non-polypoid morphology, including the often fatal 'right-sided\n      ' adenomas.\n\n      Endoscopic imaging with the use of fluorescent-labeled probes is a promising method for\n      achieving greater specificity, spatial localization and higher image contrast in the\n      detection of neoplastic lesions.

Whether either primary tumour (PT) resection\n      followed by chemotherapy or immediate chemotherapy without PT resection is the best\n      therapeutic option in patients with asymptomatic colon cancer and unresectable SLM is still\n      controversial. No randomised trial has been conducted to answer this question.\n\n      Historically, surgeons have advocated resection of the PT to avoid potential complications\n      of the intact PT (bleeding, obstruction, perforation). However, during the past decade,\n      several highly active systemic agents have become available for treatment of patients with\n      metastatic CRC. These agents have increased the median survival duration of patients with\n      unresectable metastatic disease from 9 to 12 months with 5FU alone, to 30-35 months with the\n      addition of modern cytotoxic and targeted agents. Modern agents have also demonstrated\n      increased activity on the PT as well, and have been associated with low rates of PT-related\n      complications during treatment in initially asymptomatic patients.\n\n      The impact of the strategy on survival has never been assessed properly. All published\n      studies are of non-randomized design, single center, and retrospective in most of them.\n      Moreover, few data on the use of systemic therapy are presented in these studies, which\n      makes it difficult to assess the relative contribution of resection on outcome. In addition,\n      patients with extensive disease or poor performance status were more likely to be offered\n      chemotherapy rather than surgery thus introducing a bias at the ousted. Despite these\n      limitations, PT resection at initial management of these metastatic CRC patients with\n      unresectable SLM was related to prolonged survival on multivariate analysis in the majority\n      of these series. The improvement in survival following PT resection may be attributed to the\n      potential role of the PT to provide an angiogenic prosperous environment for metastatic\n      tumour growth in the liver parenchyma adjacent to the SLM.\n\n      The present study is a multicenter randomized phase III trial designed to assess whether\n      overall survival and quality of life are improved in patients with asymptomatic unresectable\n      metastatic colon cancer treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy versus chemotherapy\n      alone.\n\n      Patients (ECOG 0-1 performance status) with asymptomatic colon cancer (>15cm from the anal\n      margin) and unresectable liver only metastatic disease on initial abdominal CT/MRI scan will\n      be randomized to either colectomy followed by chemotherapy, or chemotherapy without\n      resection of the PT. Systemic chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy will be let to\n      the investigators' discretion according to standard local practices. The primary endpoint of\n      the study is overall survival for >2 years. The secondary endpoints are: quality of life\n      (EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-CR29), treatment safety (postoperative morbidity, complications related\n      to the unresected PT, chemotherapy toxicity), progression-free survival and time to\n      metastatic progression, radiological response to chemotherapy (RECIST v1.1 criteria), and\n      the curative (R0) resection rate of metastases.\n\n      A 15% amelioration of overall survival at 2 years is expected in colectomy group (HR=0.65,\n      with a rise from 40% to 55%).

Surgery is currently the\n      primary treatment for stage I to III. Studies have shown that patients with poor\n      preoperative physical fitness are less able to cope with the adverse effects of surgery and\n      hospitalization resulting in increased risk of mortality, postoperative complications and\n      functional recovery time. Moreover, approximately 60% of colon cancer patients are older\n      than 70 years at diagnosis and more than 50% of older cancer patients have frailty or\n      pre-frailty. Frailty is a state of vulnerability decreased functional reserve, impairment or\n      dysregulation in several physiological systems, and reduced capacity to recover\n      physiological homeostasis after a stress. Nowadays, no frail definition is clearly defined.\n      One widely accepted definition uses the Fried criteria including the assessment of weight\n      loss, physical exhaustion, physical activity level, grip strength and walking speed.\n      Preoperative frail colon cancer patients have a significantly higher risk of adverse\n      postoperative outcomes including institutionalization, length of stay, morbidity and\n      mortality. It seems relevant to intervene during the preoperative period to improve the\n      patient's functional capacity before the surgery, via physical training to overcome the\n      stress of the surgery and to improve postoperative recovery. This process is called\n      \"prehabilitation\". Structured and supervised programs have shown to be effective and\n      feasible. However, time, resources and expensive care are often a barrier for the patient.\n      Thereby, a home-based tele-supervising rehabilitation would be an attractive therapeutic\n      option to offer a distinct advantage in this regard. To date, no study has studied the\n      effects of tele-supervised prehabilitation in these \"frail\" patients.\n\n      Study design A single-blind, randomized, controlled trial will be conducted. Participants\n      will be randomized into either a prehabilitation group or a control group. An assessor who\n      will be blinded to group allocation will collect outcomes measures for each participant.\n\n      Study sample To be eligible for this study participants will need to meet the following\n      criteria: diagnosis of colon cancer requiring surgery; more than 65 years of age; able to\n      read, write and understand French; Frailty phenotype criteria \u2265 3. Frailty was assessed\n      using the components of the Frailty Phenotype, which was first developed by Fried et al.,\n      which consists of five criteria: weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity, slowness,\n      and weakness.\n\n      Participants will be excluded if they have a physical impairment that would seriously impair\n      physical mobility; the surgery is an emergency; have a neuropsychiatric disease.\n\n      Intervention Participants allocated to the prehabilitation group will undertake a\n      telerehabilitation program that will start 4 weeks before the surgery while participants in\n      the control group will receive usual care and World Health Organization recommendations on\n      physical activity for health before surgery.\n\n      The telerehabilitation program will combine aerobic and resistance training three sessions\n      per week. Each 60-min session will begin and end with a five-minute warm-up/cool. The\n      warm-up will be followed by 25 minutes of aerobic training. Aerobic exercise can include\n      brisk walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming according to patient's preference. The\n      intensity of the exercise was set between 60 \u00e0 75% of maximum heart rate (maximal heart\n      rate=220 - age). And between 12 and 16 on Borg's Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale. Each\n      participant will wear a heart monitor. The aerobic training will be followed by resistance\n      exercise performed on eight exercises targeting major muscle groups (abdominal, hamstring,\n      quadriceps, triceps, gluteus maximus, paraspinal muscles and shoulder muscles). Intensity\n      must be between 12 and 16 on the Borg's Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale. A\n      physiotherapist will provide detailed information about the program. The patient will\n      receive a brochure in which there will be descriptions and pictures of exercises and a video\n      including the resistance program was recorded on a website.

The researchers hypothesized that\n      colonoscopy in older people is likely to have more complications without detection of a\n      significant number of large polyps and cancer.\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      Background and Clinical Significance:\n\n      Colorectal cancer continues to carry a significant burden of morbidity and mortality into\n      the twenty-first century, despite the availability of multiple screening modalities. It is\n      estimated that approximately 150,000 new cases of CRC will be diagnosed and over 50,000\n      people will die of CRC in 2006 (1). Current options for screening for CRC include fecal\n      occult-blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, double contrast barium enema, and colonoscopy.\n      While no randomized controlled trials have shown a mortality benefit with screening\n      colonoscopy, it has become the preferred method of both screening and surveillance of polyps\n      because of the ability to visualize the entire colon in addition to having the ability to\n      remove polyps. This procedure does associated risks including perforation and bleeding after\n      polypectomy. Other major complications have also been reported, including MI and CVA.\n\n      Although guidelines exist for colorectal cancer screening and surveillance of polyps, they\n      do not define the upper age limit to which these practices should be carried out (2,3). No\n      clear data is available on the effect of this procedure on life expectancy after the age of\n      80. Also, the country has limited resources and screening colonoscopy may be offered to\n      those who are most likely to benefit. Based on these facts, there is a real need to quantify\n      the prevalence of colon neoplasia in this age group to guide primary care physicians as well\n      as gastroenterologists in offering screening and surveillance colonoscopy to this age group.\n      Like many medical decisions, cancer screening requires weighing quantitative information,\n      such as risk of cancer death and likelihood of beneficial and adverse screening outcomes, as\n      well as qualitative factors, such as individual patients' values and preferences. In fact,\n      patients with life expectancies of less than 5 years are unlikely to derive any survival\n      benefit from cancer screening. There is also potential for harm from screening procedures.\n      Some of the greatest harms of screening occur by detecting cancers that would never have\n      become clinically significant. This becomes more likely as life expectancy decreases.\n\n      As the population ages and life expectancy continues to increase, more elderly patients will\n      be referred for colonoscopy. What is the utility of performing colonoscopy in these\n      asymptomatic patients, and is it safe? Few studies have examined this question adequately.\n      What follows is a brief review of published data in regards to yield and safety of\n      colonoscopy in the elderly.\n\n      Yield:\n\n      Lin et al examined the prevalence of neoplasia in 1244 screening colonoscopies - 63 were\n      patients older than 80. They found that although the prevalence of neoplasia increases with\n      age (28.6% in patients older than 80), the gain in expected life expectancy after\n      intervention is limited (4).\n\n      Cooper et al came to a somewhat different conclusion (7). They analyzed 1.8 million Medicare\n      patient colonoscopies in 1999 using ICD-9 codes for rates of polyp detection (pathology was\n      not examined, so it is not clear what percentage of these patients had hyperplastic polyps,\n      adenomas, advanced adenomas, or cancer). They found that the rate of polyp detection\n      decreased with age but was still high (ranging from 15.2-31.3% in patients older than 80).\n      Cooper had previously shown that the incidence of colorectal cancer increased with age in an\n      analysis of all new cases of colon cancer in Medicare patients in 19878. Similarly, the\n      National Polyp Study has shown an increase in the incidence of high grade dysplasia in\n      patients older than 60 (9).\n\n      Finally, the VA Cooperative Study Group No. 380 did a prospective cross sectional study of\n      3121 asymptomatic patients between 1994-1997 to find the prevalence of advanced neoplasia\n      and associated risk factors. 329 patients were found to have advanced neoplasia as defined\n      by an adenoma greater than 1 cm, villous histology, presence of high-grade dysplasia, or\n      cancer. Associations were found between advanced neoplasia and family history of CRC,\n      smoking, moderate to heavy alcohol consumption, fiber intake, and use of daily NSAIDS or\n      vitamin D11.\n\n      Safety:\n\n      Two of the above studies discussed safety of colonoscopy in elderly patients. Duncan found 8\n      major complications (0.6%) including 3 bleeds and 1 perforation in a series of 1199\n      colonoscopies6. Sardinha also reported a low rate of major bleeding (0.2%) and no\n      perforation in 428 colonoscopies; this compared favorably with two other studies on elderly\n      patients.10 Gatto et al took a random sample of Medicare patients who underwent a\n      colonoscopy between 1991 and 1998. 39,286 colonoscopies were identified by CPT-4 codes;\n      perforations within 7 days of the procedure were identified by ICD-9 codes. The average age\n      was 74, and 21 % of patients were older than 80. The overall incidence of perforation was\n      0.19%; the authors found that the rate of perforation increased with age and the number of\n      comorbidities12,13.\n\n      In addition to perforation and bleeding, MI and CVA have also been reported after\n      colonoscopy. Cappell studied patients who were already at higher risk for an MI or CVA. He\n      looked at 100 patients who underwent colonoscopy within 30 days after MI and compared them\n      to 100 control patients without MI or unstable angina in the preceding 6 months. He found\n      that while there was a higher rate of minor complications (transient asymptomatic\n      hypotension or bradycardia) in the study group (in which the patients were sicker overall),\n      there was only one major complication after colonoscopy which was probably not due to the\n      procedure13.\n\n      Importance of Current Research to Veterans:\n\n      The prevalence of CRC is approximately 5% (1,3). Although over 80% of cases are sporadic\n      (the remaining result from inflammatory bowel disease and hereditary colon cancer\n      syndromes), many veterans have one or more risk factors for CRC including advancing age,\n      smoking, heavy alcohol intake, high fat low fiber diet, sedentary lifestyle, and obesity. As\n      the veteran population ages, preventative services will continue to be an important part of\n      their health care. As the US population is aging, so too is the US veteran population. This\n      is further complicated by the fact that a recent study that examined the self-rated health\n      and functioning of a national sample of veterans aged 65 or older reported that over\n      one-half of elderly veterans report difficulty in functioning and rated their health status\n      as fair or poor (14). This group of veterans may also live alone, may not have easy access\n      to transportation to and from a health facility and may find it physically challenging to\n      prepare their colon with cleansing agents for a good exam during a colonoscopy. Age and\n      comorbidity also affect the survival rates after resection of colorectal cancer. A study by\n      Ko et al used nationwide data from the healthcare cost and utilization program and\n      calculated mortality among 22,000 resections for colon cancer15. They found that besides the\n      volume of surgery, two other factors that affect post colon cancer mortality are age and\n      comorbid disease (i.e. cardiovascular, pulmonary and liver diseases) (p<0.05). Another study\n      of 80 patients (16), 80 years and older, showed a postoperative mortality rate of 8% and 5yr\n      survival of only 23%. Only 13 patients lived longer than 5 years. Many elderly people may\n      need a coronary revascularization procedure before planned surgery, if a colon cancer is\n      discovered. Older age has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients undergoing\n      percutaneous coronary intervention. A study by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute\n      included 4620 PCI treated patients and reported adjusted relative risks in elderly (>80\n      years) compared to younger (<65 years) patients to be higher for inhospital related death\n      (3.64 versus 1.0) as well as myocardial infarction (2.57 versus 1.0) (17).\n\n      Based on the above data, it is useful and necessary to know the potential risks and benefits\n      of this invasive procedure in otherwise asymptomatic elderly patients.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Study Design: Computerized medical records and endoscopy reports will be searched to\n      identify patients older than 80 years old who underwent colonoscopy indicated for average\n      risk screening for colon cancer or surveillance of polyps. A control group of patients\n      between the ages of 50 and 79 will also be identified who underwent colonoscopy indicated\n      for average risk screening for colon cancer or surveillance of polyps. The ratio of controls\n      to study patients will be 2 to 1. Records will be searched from 1997 to July 31, 2006. Data\n      collected will include age at time of colonoscopy, sex, body mass index, a personal history\n      of CAD, DM, CVA, or PVD, endoscopic and histologic findings of colonoscopy, evidence of\n      complete examination, all complications during colonoscopy, evidence of complications after\n      colonoscopy including perforation, bleeding, MI, and CVA. The use of aspirin, NSAIDS,\n      calcium, and vitamin D will be recorded. A comprehensive questionnaire that will include\n      information on diet, exercise, family history, smoking, alcohol consumption, use of aspirin,\n      NSAIDS, calcium, vitamin D, and statins will be administered by the endoscopist prior to\n      colonoscopy.\n\n      Risk and Benefit to the Study Participant:\n\n      The participants will only be active in the prospective portion of the study. Their\n      participation will be limited to completion of a written survey. This will be given after\n      verbal informed consent. There will be no risk to the study participant. Benefits of this\n      study have been previously addressed in detail in the section titled \" Importance of Current\n      Research to Veterans\".\n\n      Data Collection:\n\n      Patient demographics, endoscopy and pathology findings, procedure complications,\n      comorbidities and data regarding various risk factors such as smoking, alcohol intake, lack\n      of dietary fruits and vegetables, lack of exercise, family history, prior history of colon\n      cancer, ASA, NSAID and statin use will be collected. A questionnaire for the factors\n      outlined above will be administered by an endoscopist. The data will be transferred to an\n      Excel spreadsheet by one of the study investigators.\n\n      Statistical Power and Data Analysis:\n\n      Using the SPSS software, the prevalence of colon polyps and colon cancer between the group\n      age >80 years and < 80 years will be compared. Significant polyps will be defined as polyp >\n      1 cm in size, polyps with villous histology, three or more polyps and polyps with dysplasia.\n      Hyperplastic polyps will be considered non-neoplastic. Smokers will be defined as people who\n      smoked at least 1 pack per day for 10 years and who did not quit smoking in the past 10\n      years. Associations between the clinical and demographic variables will be examined using\n      Spearman's correlation coefficients. Univariate analysis will be performed Chi-square or\n      fisher's exact test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon sum test for continuous\n      variables. A multivariate logistic regression will be performed to control for the\n      covariates that may affect the prevalence of colonic neoplasia. All tests will be\n      two-tailed. A p value of < 0.05 will be considered significant.\n    ", "overall_status": "Completed", "condition": "Colorectal Neoplasms", "eligibility": "\n        Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  All patients presenting for colonoscopy after 1997\n\n          -  Age 80 or older for the study group\n\n          -  Age 50-79 for the control group\n\n          -  Indications for colonoscopy:\n\n          -  Average risk screening for CRC\n\n          -  Surveillance of polyps (tubular adenomas)\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Any colonoscopy done for symptoms (abdominal pain, weight loss, hematochezia, occult\n             blood in stool, etc) or signs (iron deficiency anemia)\n\n          -  Patients who are not average risk based on family history of CRC\n\n          -  Diagnosis of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's Disease\n\n          -  History of CRC\n\n          -  Exams that were not completed to the cecum (except in cases of obstructing masses\n             found to be neoplastic) or poor bowel preparation limiting visualization of the\n             mucosa\n      ", "gender": "All", "gender_based": null, "minimum_age": 18, "maximum_age": 99, "keyword": ["CRC - Colorectal cancer", "CVA - Cerebral Vascular Accident", "MI - Myocardial Infarction", "CAD - Coronary Artery Disease", "DM - Diabetes Mellitus", "PVD - Peripheral Vascular Disease", "NSAIDS - Non-Steroidal Anti inflammatory Drugs", "screening", "colonoscopy"], "mesh_term": ["Colorectal Neoplasms"]}, {"nct_id": "NCT00351572", "brief_title": "Frequency of Circulating Tumour Cells in Stage II and Stage III Colon Cancer Patients", "brief_summary": "\n      This study will determine whether a new diagnostic test called the Cell Search Assay can\n      detect circulating colon cancer cells in patients who have had surgery for colon cancer and\n      had visible cancer removed.

This research says that for colorectal cancer\n      patients, the less active and more obese they are, the more likely they are to have a cancer\n      recurrence or die from their cancer. Chemotherapy has been shown to reduce activity levels,\n      fitness, and body size in some cancer patients. However, it is not known how chemotherapy\n      specific for colon cancer patients affects their activity levels, fitness, and body size.\n      The main goal of our study will be to look at how chemotherapy treatments affect the\n      fitness, activity levels, and body size in colon cancer patients. In order to do this, we\n      will measure these variables before chemotherapy treatments, and at 1 and 6 months following\n      the end of treatment. Our results will show how chemotherapy affects fitness, activity\n      levels, and body size in colon cancer patients and provide data to help in designing an\n      exercise intervention specifically for colon cancer survivors.\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      Background Information: Recent evidence has suggested that the physical activity levels and\n      body composition of colorectal cancer survivors can impact the disease-free and overall\n      survival following diagnosis, with those individuals who are more overweight or obese and\n      less active at greater risk of a recurrence of or dying from colorectal cancer (Meyerhardt\n      et al, 2006a,b; Digman et al, 2006). Chemotherapy treatments have been shown to improve\n      survival in a number of cancer populations, but unfortunately they have also been shown to\n      negatively impact numerous physiological and psychological variables, including reduced\n      exercise capacity, self-reported physical functioning and activity levels, and negative\n      changes in body composition (Schmitz et al, 2005). This suggests that chemotherapy\n      treatments may negatively impact variables that have been associated with survival in\n      individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer. However, this research has been conducted in\n      cancer populations other than colorectal cancer patients, hence the specific impact of the\n      chemotherapy treatments for colorectal cancer on these outcomes is not known.\n\n      Objectives: The primary objective of the study is to determine the effects of chemotherapy\n      treatments on the aerobic capacity and body composition of colon cancer patients. Secondary\n      objectives are to determine the effects of chemotherapy treatments on quality of life,\n      fatigue, performance status, self-reported and objectively measured physical functioning,\n      exercise behaviour, oxygen uptake kinetics, muscular strength, and anthropometric variables.\n\n      Study Design: The study parameters assessed will include descriptive information on\n      demographic, lifestyle and medical variables; a graded exercise test with metabolic\n      measurement to determine peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak); air-displacement plethysmography\n      (BOD POD) testing and anthropometric measurements (waist & hip circumferences, waist-to-hip\n      ratio, body mass index) to assess body composition; a questionnaire to determine\n      cancer-specific quality of life and fatigue (Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment -\n      Colorectal and Fatigue); performance status assessment (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group\n      performance status); self-reported (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Physical Function\n      Scale) and objectively measured (Physical Functional Performance-10 and Senior's Fitness\n      Tests) physical functioning; self-reported exercise behavior (Godin Leisure Time Exercise\n      Questionnaire); submaximal exercise test with metabolic measurement to determine oxygen\n      uptake kinetics; an 8-repetition maximum test to assess upper (bench press) and lower (leg\n      press) body muscular strength; and a fasted blood sample to be used for future biomarkers\n      assays. All of these assessments will be completed at baseline prior to the subject's first\n      chemotherapy infusion, and 1 and 6 months after the completion of all chemotherapy\n      infusions.\n\n      The following calculation was used to estimate the required sample size based on the primary\n      outcome of aerobic capacity (Peak Oxygen Consumption; VO2peak): n = 2 + C (s/d)2 (Snedecor\n      et al, 1989), where C is a constant equal to 7.85 for a power of 0.80 and alpha of 0.05, s\n      is the standard deviation of 6.0 ml/kg/min, and d is a 3.5 ml/kg/min difference between\n      groups. Therefore, a sample size of 25 subjects is required to detect a 1 Metabolic\n      Equivalent (MET) or 3.5 ml/kg/min reduction in VO2peak in colorectal cancer survivors\n      following the completion of chemotherapy treatment, with a standard deviation (SD) in oxygen\n      consumption of 6.0 ml/kg/min, a power of 0.80, and an alpha set at p<0.05 (two-tailed). Each\n      1 MET change in exercise capacity has been positively associated with a 12% difference in\n      overall survival in the general population (Myers et al, 2002). A sample of 30 subjects will\n      be recruited to account for any subjects lost to follow-up. To compare the effects of\n      chemotherapy treatment on the study assessments to colon cancer surgery alone, 10 subjects\n      will be recruited to complete all of the study assessments at the same 3 time points to\n      allow for a \"surgery only\" comparison group.\n\n      Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Inclusion criteria will include: 1)histologically confirmed\n      colon cancer (Stage III and those Stage II patients deemed high-risk 2) approval of the\n      treating oncologist 3) they will receive chemotherapy 4) able to understand and provide\n      written informed consent in English 5) 18+ years of age 6) no uncontrolled co-morbidities\n      (including hypertension, cardiac illness, psychiatric condition, etc.) negative ECG as\n      assessed during maximal graded exercise test *Ten patients meeting all eligibility\n      requirements except for criteria 3 will be recruited to the study to serve as \"surgery only\"\n      controls.\n\n      Exclusion criteria include 1) metastatic or recurrent colon cancer patients; 2) pregnancy;\n      3) any uncontrolled medical condition that would be a contraindication to exercise (assessed\n      by treating oncologist); 4) unwilling to attend, travel to, or participate in the\n      assessments at all 3 time points.\n\n      Recruitment: Patients will be recruited from outpatient colorectal clinics at the Cross\n      Cancer Institute. The project coordinator will be present at all clinics, and in conjunction\n      with the treating oncologist and clinic nurses will screen patient lists to determine\n      eligibility for that day. The treating medical oncologist will have final determination of\n      patient eligibility for the study and will introduce the trial to the patient if they are\n      deemed to meet all eligibility requirements. If the patient expresses interest, he or she\n      will be approached by the project coordinator who will discuss the study in further detail\n      and will also give the patient a study information package. The patient will be told that a\n      follow-up phone call will be made in the next few days to confirm if the patient is\n      interested in participating in the trial. If the patient is still interested, all baseline\n      testing appointments will be scheduled. Based on an estimate of 8 new colon cancer patients\n      eligible for the study in clinic per week and a 15% accrual rate, it should take\n      approximately 36 weeks to recruit the required number of subjects (n = 30).\n\n      Statistical Analysis: Data will be analyzed using SPSS version 15.0 software (SPSS, Inc.,\n      Evanston, IL). The principal analyses of end points will employ the last observation carried\n      forward approach. Independent t-tests will be used to test for variables differentiating\n      between patients accepting/declining participation and completing/dropping out of study.\n      Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize all study assessment data at each time\n      point. The changes in measured outcomes from baseline to post-chemotherapy (4 weeks post) to\n      recovery (24 weeks post-chemotherapy) will be analysed using a one-way analysis of variance\n      for repeated measures. Any differences in study outcomes between subjects receiving\n      chemotherapy versus those who are receiving surgery alone will be analysed using a two-way\n      analysis of variance for repeated measures.\n\n      Stopping Rules: Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time, which includes\n      stopping at any point during any of the study assessments.\n\n      Data Safety Monitoring Committee: Ethical and scientific approval will be obtained from\n      Alberta Cancer Board and the Health Ethics Research Board at the University of Alberta. All\n      data will be number coded so that the identity of participants cannot be traced. All data\n      will be kept in a secure, locked cabinet in the Behavioral Medicine Laboratory and will only\n      be accessible to members of the research team. The local Institutional Research Ethics\n      Boards will oversee the validity and integrity of data by conducting periodic audits of\n      study records.\n\n      The safety of participants will be of primary concern at all times. Study investigators will\n      monitor participants during all study assessments. All adverse events, however minor, will\n      be recorded. All serious adverse events will be reported to the local Institutional Research\n      Ethics Boards, as well as each participant's treating oncologist. The project coordinator,\n      under the supervision of the principal investigator, will be responsible for reporting any\n      serious adverse events.\n\n      References:\n\n      Dignam JJ, Polite BN, Yothers G, Raich P, Colangelo L, O'Connell MJ, Wolmark N.

Hepatoblastoma, an\n      embryonal tumor of the liver, is rare in the general population. It occurs in approximately\n      1 in 50,000 children. However, families affected with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, in\n      which there is a high incidence of colon cancer, have an 850 fold increase in the frequency\n      of Hepatoblastoma. Hepatoblastoma also occurs in association with Beckwith-Wiedemann\n      Syndrome. Thus the occurrence of Hepatoblastoma suggests the need for both careful\n      investigations into the family history of malignancies in relatives, as well as a search for\n      genetic alterations that may contribute to tumor development.\n\n      COG cancer researchers are trying to better understand the causes of Hepatoblastoma. They\n      want to develop improved methods for treatment, diagnosis and possibly even prevention. The\n      exact molecules or genes to be studied will change over time as progress in cancer research\n      is made. Not every gene or molecule known to be involved in cancer will be studied.\n      Researchers will choose to study only those genes or molecules which they think are most\n      promising. At present, the study of at least three genes is planned.\n\n      In some cases these changes may be detected in normal tissues such as liver or blood cells.\n      One of the genes to be studied is known as the APC gene. It is linked with colon cancer in\n      adults. Rarely this gene can be passed on in families which are prone to develop both colon\n      cancer and Hepatoblastoma. We don't know how common changes in this gene are in children\n      with Hepatoblastoma. This study will try and figure out if this gene is commonly changed in\n      Hepatoblastoma.\n\n      In addition to studying specific genes or molecules, geneticists (doctors who specialize in\n      looking at genes) will look at the overall genetic content of tumors from some of the\n      children involved in this study. This will be done by what is known as a karyotype or\n      chromosome analysis. It is known that some Hepatoblasomas have extra copies of certain\n      chromosomes. However, we do not know what effect these extra chromosomes might have on\n      predicting which children will be most likely to respond to treatment. One of the goals of\n      the study is to figure out what biological factors within the tumors, including extra\n      chromosomes, might help predict which children will respond best to treatment. This will\n      hopefully lead to better treatment of Hepatoblastoma.\n\n      A single extra blood sample will be taken from the patient for this study. We will take no\n      more than 1 1/2 teaspoons of blood. This amount may be less for very small infants. We will\n      also take a single blood sample (1 tablespoon) from the parent.\n\n      A portion of tumor tissue that is removed from the patient's surgery or biopsy will also be\n      sent. No extra procedures will be done to get the tumor tissue. It will be taken during a\n      surgery that is needed for standard care.\n\n      Patients will also be asked to complete a questionnaire about their background. They may\n      also be asked to complete a follow-up questionnaire or to provide additional information in\n      the future.\n    ", "overall_status": "Withdrawn", "condition": "Hepatoblastoma", "eligibility": "\n        Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients with hepatoblastoma.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n      ", "gender": "All", "gender_based": null, "minimum_age": 6, "maximum_age": 21, "keyword": [], "mesh_term": ["Hepatoblastoma"]}, {"nct_id": "NCT00274209", "brief_title": "Chromoendoscopy for Ulcerative Colitis Surveillance", "brief_summary": "\n      Long-standing ulcerative colitis is associated with an increased cancer risk.\n      Chromoendoscopy with dye spraying can detect subtle abnormalities that are not visible with\n      standard endoscopy.

For this reason, increasing\n      numbers of colon cancer patients are undergoing laparoscopic surgery.1-3 Similarly, there\n      are many potential benefits to performing rectal surgery laparoscopically. Although not well\n      documented, laparoscopic rectal surgery is under active study and may result in the usual\n      short-term benefits associated with laparoscopic surgery. In addition, compared to open\n      surgery, laparoscopy can provide unprecedented, unobstructed views of the rectal dissection\n      planes even in a patient with narrow pelvis, not only for the surgeon but to the entire\n      surgical team. Magnified views of the surgical planes allow precise and sharp dissection.\n      The pneumoperitoneum can also help open the planes for mobilization of the mesorectum.\n\n      Despite these potential advantages, adoption of laparoscopic rectal surgery has been limited\n      for many reasons. Although there are now several prospective randomized trials demonstrating\n      safety and benefits associated with laparoscopic colon cancer surgery, the same benefits\n      have not yet been clearly demonstrated for laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery.1-3 In\n      addition, concerns about inadequate oncologic rectal dissection, anastomotic complications,\n      and technical challenges have limited wide adaptation of laparoscopic rectal surgery.4,5 In\n      efforts to retain the benefits of laparoscopic surgery while not compromising oncologic\n      rectal dissection, others have advocated performing hybrid procedures in which colonic\n      portion of the surgery is performed using the \"pure\" laparoscopic technique and rectal\n      dissection is performed open through a limited low midline or Pfannestiel (low transverse)\n      incision.6\n\n      Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery is a technique in which the surgeon places a hand into\n      the abdomen through an airtight access device while performing laparoscopic surgery. By\n      placing a hand into the abdomen during laparoscopy, surgeons retain their abilities to\n      manually retract, expose, and manually dissect, which are lost in pure laparoscopic surgery.\n      Retention of these abilities can significantly expedite the operation. In fact, several\n      studies have demonstrated that hand-assisted laparoscopic colon surgery results in\n      significantly shorter operative time and less conversion to open surgery while maintain\n      similar short-term outcomes compared to \"pure\" laparoscopic technique.7-9 In rectal surgery\n      for cancer, sigmoid colon, left colon, and splenic flexure need to be mobilized in order to\n      allow tension free anastomosis between the colon and the residual rectum. In laparoscopic\n      proctectomy, HALS compared to SLS technique may therefore, result in shorter operative time\n      based on colonic portion of the operation alone.\n\n      One of the technical hurdles in performing laparoscopic rectal dissection is exposure and\n      retraction of the rectum. As one dissects down to the distal rectum, especially in patients\n      with narrow pelvis, crowding and clashing of instruments can result in poor exposure and\n      dissection. The only prospective randomized trial comparing results of open vs. laparoscopic\n      surgery to include rectal cancer is CLASICC trial.3 It reported an increased\n      circumferentially positive margin of cancer following laparoscopic rectal resection with\n      twice as many patients in the laparoscopic group (12 %) having an involved margin as in the\n      open group (6 %). This increased radial margin may be related to difficulty in retraction\n      and exposure. In HALS, rectal exposure and dissection can be either performed directly\n      through the incision using the open techniques or laparoscopically with manual assistance.\n      This may result in equivalent oncologic outcomes as the open surgery but with shorter\n      operative time compared to SLS technique.\n\n      A further challenge in laparoscopic rectal surgery is localization of the tumor, which is\n      less of an issue in colon cancer where the tumor is easily visible or tattooed\n      preoperatively. This is not possible for rectal cancer, which can pose a problem in both\n      dissection and safe division of the rectum. Without tactile sensation it can be difficult to\n      be sure that the stapler is below the tumor. Hand assisted laparoscopic surgery allows\n      preservation of tactile sensation and therefore circumvent the above problem. The next step\n      following mobilization of the rectum is division of the rectum and anastomosis. This poses a\n      challenge for the laparoscopic surgeon for several reasons. The current laparoscopic\n      stapling devices angulate to a maximum of 65 o making horizontal division of the rectum\n      difficult. Morin et al reported a leak rate of 17 % below 12 cm from the anal verge and as\n      high as 25 % in those who were not diverted following laparoscopic rectal surgery.4 Leroy et\n      al reported a similar leak rate of 20 % in cancers below 15 cm following laparoscopic rectal\n      surgery.5 Comparatively higher leak rates after laparoscopic rectal surgery may be related\n      to limitations in currently available laparoscopic surgical staplers. By performing distal\n      rectal division through the incision by using the open surgical staplers, hand-assisted\n      laparoscopic rectal surgery may result in lower anastomotic leakage rate.\n\n      We hypothesize that hand-assisted laparoscopy may result in shorter operative time while\n      retaining the benefits associated with laparoscopic surgery. In this study, we plan to\n      randomly assign patients diagnosed with rectal cancer to undergo either \"standard\"\n      laparoscopic surgery or hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery. We will then compare both\n      peri-operative and long-term outcomes of patients. If our hypothesis is true, hand assisted\n      laparoscopic approach to rectal surgery may be preferable to standard laparoscopic surgery.\n    ", "overall_status": "Unknown status", "condition": "Rectal Cancer", "eligibility": "\n        Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Age > = 18 years of age\n\n          -  Histologically proven rectal cancer\n\n          -  Inferior margin of the cancer located within 15 cm from the anal verge as determined\n             by rigid sigmoidoscopy\n\n          -  No evidence of distant metastases\n\n          -  Childbearing age women with negative pregnancy test\n\n          -  Patient is a candidate for elective rectal resection\n\n          -  The patient, or their representative, is able to understand the study and is willing\n             to consent to participation in the study.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Age < 18 years of age\n\n          -  Surgically unresectable rectal cancer\n\n          -  Patients who will require APR or hand-sewn colo-anal anastomosis\n\n          -  ASA class 4 or 5\n\n          -  Patients having additional surgical procedures which may have affect recovery\n\n          -  Child bearing age women with positive pregnancy test\n\n          -  Patients with contraindication for treatment by laparoscopy\n\n          -  Patients or their representative who are unable to understand the conditions and\n             objectives of the study\n      ", "gender": "All", "gender_based": null, "minimum_age": 18, "maximum_age": 99, "keyword": ["hand assisted laparoscopy", "rectal cancer", "short term outcomes", "straight laparoscopy"], "mesh_term": ["Rectal Neoplasms"]}, {"nct_id": "NCT01835925", "brief_title": "Rectal Cancer Consortium", "brief_summary": "\n      The purpose of this study is to study which genes are abnormal in rectal cancer and see if\n      this predicts how well chemotherapy and radiation will reduce the size of cancer and whether\n      cancer recurs after surgery.\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      Specific gene mutations have become targets for specific therapies.

Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n      Arm I (Perioperative 5-FU): Within 24 hours of the colon resection, patients receive\n      perioperative 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) intravenously (IV) over 24 hours for 7 days.\n\n      Arm II (No perioperative 5-FU): Patients receive no perioperative fluorouracil.\n\n      After surgery, patients with stage I, stage IIA, or stage IV colon cancer are immediately\n      removed from study. Patients with stage IIB, IIC, or III colon cancer are re-registered\n      within 35 days postoperatively. Beginning 21-35 days after surgery, patients with stage IIC\n      or III disease receive leucovorin calcium IV bolus immediately followed by 5-FU IV bolus on\n      days 1-5.

Nonpharmacological interventions that\n      promote relaxation and reduce psychological distress are associated with a reduction of pain\n      suggesting that psychological distress and anxiety may mediate the relationship between\n      symptom severity and QOL. Pilot data from a sample of 28 end-stage cancer patients supports\n      the mediational role of psychological distress in the symptom severity - QOL relationship.\n      The results indicated that the mere presence or absence of a physical symptom is not related\n      to patient QOL. Rather, greater symptom severity was associated with significantly poorer\n      QOL, and when the effects of psychological distress were controlled, the relationships\n      between symptom severity and QOL were no longer significant. The proposed research focuses\n      on psychological distress as an underlying mechanism of physical symptom severity among EOL\n      cancer patients and a non-traditional approach (acupuncture) to relieving distress and\n      symptom severity. Acupuncture has been used successfully with end-of-life populations (EOL)\n      to reduce pain and shortness of breath [4].

The second purpose is to assess single port surgery in terms of\n      length of stay in the hospital, analgesics requirement, and length of scar at 30 days. The\n      single port surgery is a latest advancement towards achieving minimal scarring after major\n      abdominal surgery.\n\n      Justification:\n\n      Laparoscopic Colon resection is well-documented and standard practice in many centers\n      throughout the world. A Cochrane Review of 25 Randomized Control Trials (RCT) published in\n      2005 looked at the short term (30 Days) benefits of laparoscopic colorectal resection showed\n      better outcome in intra-operative blood loss, intensity of postoperative pain, postoperative\n      hospital stay, duration of postoperative ileus, and pulmonary functions (1). Total morbidity\n      and local (surgical) morbidity was decreased in the laparoscopic groups. Until the 30th\n      postoperative day, quality of life was better in laparoscopic patients. They concluded if\n      the long-term oncological results of laparoscopic and conventional resection of colonic\n      carcinoma show equivalent results, the laparoscopic approach should be preferred in patients\n      suitable for this approach to colectomy. A Cochrane Review published in 2008 looked at 33\n      RCT's comparing laparoscopic/Laparoscopic-assisted and open colectomy for colo-rectal\n      carcinoma found similar long-term oncologic outcomes in both groups (2).\n\n      Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) instead of traditional 4 ports theoretically may\n      reduce the wound complications. For cholecystectomy, a blinded randomized control study\n      showed significant reduction in pain control at sub-costal port-sites in 2-port versus\n      4-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy and also showed similar pain at umbilical port (3).\n\n      There have been few reports of performing colectomy through a single port similar to the\n      SILS cholecystectomy as mentioned above. Remzi et al published a report of performing\n      sigmoid-colectomy for polyp using single umbilical tri-port system (4). Merchant et al used\n      a single port (this time a Gel-port) to perform SILS right hemicolectomy (5). Bucher\n      reported a case of single incision laparoscopic sigmoidectomy for stenosis due to\n      endometriosis (6). They questioned if SILS colectomy offers benefits except in cosmesis,\n      when compared to standard laparoscopic surgery.\n\n      The above-mentioned publications of SILS colectomy used conventional and not so conventional\n      instruments (curved and/or articulating forceps). The availability of these instruments due\n      to technical advancement has opened the door for these procedures to be performed more\n      routinely. In a recent study this technique was applied effectively and performed in\n      comparable operative times to traditional 3-port cholecystectomy with a learning curve of\n      approximately 5 cases (7).\n\n      Recently Dixon et al.(8) demonstrated by performing variety of colo-rectal procedures using\n      a single port laparoscopic technique. They performed, right hemi-colectomy, extended right\n      hemi-colectomy, total colectomy with ileo-anal anastomosis, procto-colectomy, restorative\n      procto-colectomy with ileo-anal pouch formation and anterior resection. Two of these\n      procedures were for cancers. All operations were performed using a single incision tri-port\n      system with harmonics scalpel, linear/circular stapler and standard laparoscopic\n      instruments.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      The investigators will assess short-term outcome variables for the single incision\n      laparoscopic resection procedure in a pilot study of 20 patients diagnosed with resectable\n      right colon cancer. The investigators will compare these short term outcome variables to an\n      aggregate group of patients that previously had undergone standard 4-port laparoscopic\n      resection of right colon cancer in a 12-month period (2009).\n\n      The outcome variables are:\n\n        1.
