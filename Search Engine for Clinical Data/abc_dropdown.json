Bimodal age distribution, a nonrandom chromosome abnormality [t(2;5)(p23;q35)] that produces a chimeric protein p80npm/alk, and a variable (5-47%) association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) have been reported. We reviewed 36 cases of ALCL (19 were children < 20 yr and 17 were adults) by focusing on the presence or absence of p80npm/alk protein and EBV. Immunophenotyping studies were performed on frozen and/or paraffin sections before initiation of chemotherapy. The p80 protein was immunohistochemically examined, and EBV-encoded RNA transcripts were detected by in situ hybridization. Among 19 cases in children, 13 cases had a T-cell and 6 cases had a null-cell phenotype. p80 Was detected in 16 (84.2%) of 19 cases in children and 3 (17.6%) of 17 cases in adults. All of the 19 cases of p80-positive ALCL were positive for epithelial membrane antigen, regardless of age. EBV genome was not detected in any of 19 cases in children and in only 2 of 15 cases in adults. ALCL in childhood seems to constitute a homogeneous entity characterized by expression of p80 and absence of EBV.

Examination of a biopsy specimen obtained by duodenal endoscopy revealed malignant lymphoma, and surgery confirmed a large mass located in the region from the intra-pancreatic tissue around the lower common bile duct to the peri-pancreatic lymph nodes. Histologically, this tumor was composed mainly of large and giant neoplastic cells. Immunohistochemically, these cells were diffusely positive for Ki-1 and CD45RO antigens, indicating the features of Ki-1 anaplastic large cell lymphoma with a T-cell phenotype among non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The histologic types of the majority of malignant lymphomas of the pancreas reported previously were considered to be diffuse-type non-Hodgkin lymphoma (probably with predominance of the B-cell phenotype), except for a single Japanese lymphoma case with a T-cell phenotype.

These lymphomas express epithelial membrane antigen (as do ALCL), but also contain intracytoplasmic IgA of a single light chain type (five cases) and an endoplasmic reticulum-associated marker detected by antibody VS38. They lack lineage-associated leukocyte antigens with the exception of CD4 (5 of 5 cases) and CD57 (5 of 7 cases). They are labeled by antibodies detecting both the intracytoplasmic and extracellular regions of the ALK receptor kinase, suggesting that they express the full-length form of this molecule. This was confirmed by Western blotting (in the one case tested) which showed a band of 200 kD in tumor cell lysates, and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of mRNA encoding intracellular and extracellular ALK sequences (in the two cases tested). There was no evidence by cytogenetics (one case analyzed) or reverse transcriptase-PCR (three cases tested) of the 2; 5 translocation or the resultant NPM-ALK gene, as is commonly found in ALCL.

In the present study, we have assessed the expression of alpha 4 beta 7 on B- and T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of different primary localization and on related normal lymphocytes. Among B-lineage lymphomas, expression of alpha 4 beta 7 was present in the majority of cases of malignant lymphomatous polyposis of the intestine and low-grade lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue/monocytoid B-cell lymphoma and in some cases of precursor B-cell lymphoma. CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma, (nodal) mantle cell lymphoma, follicular center cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were virtually always alpha 4 beta 7 negative, as was the case when localized in the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. The normal B cells of the follicle mantles and part of the B cells of the extrafollicular B-cell compartment of lymphoid tissues expressed moderate levels of alpha 4 beta 7. By contrast, follicular center cells were alpha 4 beta 7 negative. Among T-lineage lymphomas, expression of alpha 4 beta 7 was also strongly related to the primary localization; in mucosal, nodal, and cutaneous T cell lymphomas the percentage of positive cases was 56%, 17%, and 0%, respectively. All cases of precursor T-cell lymphoma were alpha 4 beta 7 negative. High expression of alpha 4 beta 7 was found on a subset of peripheral blood memory T cells as well as on lymphocytes in the intestinal mucosa. We conclude that non-Hodgkin's lymphomas that are related to mucosa-associated B- and T-lymphocyte populations selectively express the mucosal homing receptor alpha 4 beta 7. The presence of this receptor underscores their distinctive character and may play an important role in determining their characteristic mucosal dissemination pattern.", "pubmed": "9060830"}, {"title": "Detection of the t(2;5)(p23;q35) and NPM-ALK fusion in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization.", "abstract": "The non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subset commonly referred to as large cell lymphoma (LCL) has historically been characterized by it's marked cytological, immunological, and clinical heterogeneity. One potential defining feature of these lymphomas, the t(2;5)(p23;q35), occurs in 25% to 30% of anaplastic LCLs and is also found in cases with diffuse large cell or immunoblastic morphology. We recently identified nucleophosmin (NPM) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) as the genes on chromosomes 5 and 2, respectively, that are juxtaposed by this translocation. To provide a complementary approach to the use of classical cytogenetics or polymerase chain reaction-based methods for the detection of this abnormality, we have developed a two-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assay for the t(2;5) that may be used for the analysis of both interphase nuclei and metaphase chromosomes. Three overlapping chromosome 5 cosmid clones located immediately centromeric to the NPM gene locus and an ALK P1 clone located telomeric to the chromosome 2 breakpoint were labeled with digoxigenin or biotin, respectively, and used to visualize the derivative chromosome 5 produced by the t(2;5), evident as juxtaposed or overlapping red and green fluorescent signals. This NPM-ALK FISH assay was initially validated by analysis of a series of cytogenetically characterized cell lines, with the presence of the der(5) chromosome showed specifically only in those lines known to contain the t(2;5). The assay was then applied in a blinded fashion to a series of eight cytogenetically t(2;5)-positive clinical specimens and seven known t(2;5)-negative cases, including three NHL and four Hodgkin's disease biopsy samples. Whereas the t(2;5)-negative cases were negative by FISH, all eight t(2;5)-positive cases were positive. One additional case, initially thought to be positive for the translocation by cytogenetics, was proven to not be a classic t(2;5) by interphase and metaphase FISH. These data indicate that the FISH assay described is a highly specific and rapid test that should prove to be a useful adjunct to the currently available methods for detection of the t(2;5).", "pubmed": "9057650"}, {"title": "Molecular characterization of ALK, a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed specifically in the nervous system.", "abstract": "The 2;5 chromosomal translocation is frequently associated with anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs). The translocation creates a fusion gene consisting of the alk (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) gene and the nucelophosmin (npm) gene: the 3' half of alk derived from chromosome 2 is fused to the 5' portion of npm from chromosome 5. A recent study shows that the product of the npm-alk fusion gene is oncogenic. To help understand how the npm-alk oncogene transform cells, it is important to investigate the normal biological function of the alk gene product, ALK. Here, we show molecular cloning of cDNAs for both the human and mouse ALK proteins. The deduced amino acid sequences reveal that ALK is a novel receptor protein-tyrosine kinase having a putative transmembrane domain and an extracellular domain. These sequences are absent in the product of the transforming npm-alk gene. ALK shows the greatest sequence similarity to LTK (leukocyte tyrosine kinase) whose biological function is presently unknown. RNA blot hybridization analysis of various tissues reveals that the alk mRNA is dominantly detected in the brain and spinal cord. Immunoblotting with anti-ALK antibody shows that ALK is highly expressed in the neonatal brain. Furthermore, RNA in situ hybridization analysis shows that the alk mRNA is dominantly expressed in neurons in specific regions of the nervous system such as the thalamus, mid-brain, olfactory bulb, and ganglia of embryonic and neonatal mice.

Paradoxically, the normal human stomach is devoid of organized MALT within which a lymphoma can develop. Lymphoid tissue is acquired in the stomach in response to antigenic stimulation, predominantly associated with Helicobacter pylori infection. Studies of patients with low-grade MALT lymphoma have confirmed a high incidence of H. pylori infection and suggest that the infection predates neoplastic transformation. Certain morphological features of MALT lymphomas suggest that the tumor cells remain responsive to antigen drive. Given the close association between gastric MALT lymphoma and H. pylori, it is possible that this organism provides such a drive. In vitro studies have shown that the tumor cells proliferate in a T-cell-dependent way to the presence of H. pylori. Several studies have now demonstrated that eradication of the organism in patients with low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma can result in regression of the tumor.

Using both Northern blot analysis and zymography, gelatinase B activity was detected by zymography in two Burkitt cell lines and in a tonsillar cell suspension, while gelatinase A and interstitial collagenase activities were not detected by either method. TIMP-1 expression was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis in the multipotential neoplastic K-562 cell line, the high grade Burkitt's B-cell lymphoma lines, isolated tonsillar B cells and at low levels in peripheral blood T cells, but was not expressed in any of the neoplastic T-cell lines or isolated peripheral blood B cells. In contrast, TIMP-2 expression was restricted to tissues containing cells of T-cell lineage with high levels being observed in the neoplastic T-cell lines and lower levels in normal peripheral blood T cells and hyperplastic tonsil. Expression of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 was confirmed at the protein level by reverse zymography and immunofluorescence assays using antihuman TIMP polyclonal antibodies. Expression of gelatinase B by the high grade B-cell Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines is consistent with previous findings in large cell immunoblastic lymphomas and indicates that this enzyme may play an important role in high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.

The other two cases of lymphoma were incidental findings on hysterectomy procedures performed for prolapse and cervical dysplasia, respectively. All three lymphomas occurred in patients in their sixties; none formed gross tumors. Histologic examination revealed lymphoid nodules adjacent to endometrial glands. The lymphoid cells showed mild nuclear enlargement and slight irregularities of the nuclear contour. None of the three patients had evidence of disease outside the endometrium by physical examination, bone marrow biopsy, or sampling of pelvic lymph nodes.

In the third case, a faint band was found superimposed on a background smear, suggesting the presence of a B-cell clone. In contrast, the two examples of histologically benign lymphoid aggregates of the endometrium consisted predominantly of T cells with rare B-lymphocytes; there was no evidence of coexpression of CD43 by B-cells. The PCR amplification from the benign lymphoid aggregates did not support a clonal process.

In this report we summarize the results of a prospective comparative study investigating the therapy outcome of 27 patients (pts) with PTCL and 55 pts. with high grade B-cell NHL and give an overview of therapy studies in PTCL. The histological subtypes were 14 pleomorphic, 8 large-cell anaplastic (Ki-1+), 2 angioimmunoblastic (AILD) and 3 other PTCL. In three patients the PTCL was associated with non-tropical sprue (11%).

Morphologically, 31 cases were identified by atypical pleomorphic lymphoid infiltrates with polymorphous, angicentric, and necrotic features. Their lymphoma cells ranged in size from small to large and were mixed in varying proportion from case to case. The other one case showed a monomorphic 'blastic' appearance. EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) was detected in the neoplastic cells of 27 of the 32 cases examined. In the five EBV-negative cases, one was the 'blastic' type.

Most are clinically aggressive B-cell lymphomas exhibiting Burkitt-type, immunoblastic or large-cell morphology. Approximately 80% arise systemically (nodal or extranodal), and the remaining 20% arise in the central nervous system. A small proportion are body cavity-based (primary effusion) lymphomas associated with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection. Possible factors contributing to lymphoma development include HIV-induced immunosuppression, chronic antigenic stimulation, and cytokine overproduction. These phenomena are associated with the development of oligoclonal B-cell expansions. The appearance of malignant lymphoma is characterized by the presence of a monoclonal B-cell population displaying a variety of genetic lesions including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections, c-myc gene rearrangement, bcl-6 gene rearrangement, ras gene mutations, and p53 gene mutations/deletions. The number and type of genetic lesions varies according to anatomic site of origin and histopathology. In the case of Burkitt-type lymphoma, virtually 100% exhibit c-myc gene rearrangement, two thirds display p53 gene mutations, one third contain EBV, and none exhibit bcl-6 gene rearrangements. In contrast, in the case of immunoblastic lymphoma, virtually 100% contain EBV, 25% display c-myc gene rearrangements, 20% display bcl-6 gene rearrangements, and few exhibit p53 gene mutations.

T- and B-lymphoid cells were immunostained with anti-CD3 and CD20, respectively. The tissue sections from the EBER-positive T-cell lymphoma were stained by nonisotopic in situ hybridization. Single cells were mobilized after proteolytic treatment under an inverted microscope using a hydraulic micromanipulator at a magnification of 400 x. Isolated cells were aspirated into a micropipette fixed to a second micromanipulator and transferred into a PCR tube. The IgH complementarity determining region (CDR)3 was successfully amplified in 17 of 52 (33%) small B-lymphocytes from lymphocytic predominance Hodgkin's disease using a previously reported semi-nested PCR method, and the products from each case differed in size as expected of a polyclonal population. None of the 49 small T lymphocytes demonstrated any amplifiable IgH CDR3 products, indicating no significant cellular contamination. The IgH CDR3 sequence analysis of the PCR products indicated a clonal relationship among harvested cells. In the T-cell lymphoma case, the harvested EBER-positive cells were amplifiable for the multiple-copy fragment BamHI-W of the EBV genome.

The functional activity of L-selectins was assessed with L-selectin ligand analogs (polyphosphomonester core polysaccharide: PPME and fucoidin). Leukemic B cells were identified with phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) anti-CD19, anti-kappa/lambda investigated simultaneously for the expression of adhesion receptors estimated with fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated McAbs. The percentage of leukemic cells expressing L-selectins (Leu-8) was high in CLL (52% of positive cases) and integrin expression (LFA-1, VLA-4, 5) was low (19 and 33%, respectively), while a reverse pattern, low Leu-8 (17%), and a high VLA-4 (77%), was observed in non-CLL cases. The expression of LFA-1 alpha-chain was variable in non-CLL cases, and the LFA-1 heterodimer was expressed on most clonal B cell in NHLs (92%). LFA-1 alpha-chain was detected on cells from only one HCL case, while beta2 integrin was regularly expressed on hairy cells. VLA-5 integrin was found on a relatively small number (26%) of mature B cell leukemias. A remarkable finding was the detection of ICAM-1 in all CLL cases albeit the number of positive cells was significantly lower (P < 0.05) compared to non-CLL cases. CD44 was expressed on a high number of neoplastic cells in all the investigated categories. There was no correlation between the expression of the adhesion molecules and clinical and laboratory parameters except for CD18 which was expressed on a significantly (P < 0.05) higher number of leukemic cells in CLL with more advanced stages.

Accumulating evidence, however, now suggests that LCC is merely a reactive change. Having often observed LCC in liver specimens with chronic biliary tract disease, that is, in livers where cholestasis preceded hepatocyte injury, we surmised that LCC may be a result of prolonged cholestasis. To determine whether there was any association between LCC and cholestasis, we examined microscopically a series of 400 nodules from 40 consecutive adult cirrhotic livers, resected on transplantation, and graded LCC and cholestasis semiquantitatively. LCC was present diffusely in cirrhotic nodules of 25 specimens (62.5%). Nine additional specimens (22.5%) had focal mild LCC. Usually, LCC and cholestasis occurred together, in the same cirrhotic nodules and in the same areas of nodules. There was a statistically significant association between the presence and grade of LCC and those of cholestasis (p < 0.0001; chi-square test). Within etiological categories of cirrhosis (chronic hepatitis; n = 28; alcoholic liver disease; n = 6; biliary disease: n = 6), the significance was maintained.

We investigated the role of IP-10 in the biology of CTCL by using immunocytochemistry to define IP-10 expression in normal and CTCL skin biopsies. Using purified recombinant (r) IP-10, we generated a rabbit antiserum that recognized and neutralized rIP-10 but did not cross-react with any keratinocyte proteins or any other chemokine. Immunoperoxidase staining of normal epidermis demonstrated that IP-10 was expressed by basal but not by differentiated keratinocytes. The epidermis overlying CTCL lesions was often hyperplastic, IP-10 immunostaining was enhanced compared to normal skin, and extended to the suprabasal keratinocytes in 25 of 26 patients for a frequency of 96%; and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 80% to 100%.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of E-selectin on cultured human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) isolated from neonatal foreskins when exposed to IL-10. Expression of E-selectin was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy, FACS analysis, an HL-60 cell-binding assay, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. For comparison with large blood vessel cells, the expression of E-selectin on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was also determined in parallel by FACS and reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis under identical conditions. These studies demonstrate that IL-10 induces the expression of E-selectin on both HDMEC and HUVEC and that the level of expression of HDMEC is comparable with that induced by IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. When HL-60 cells are incubated with HDMEC pretreated with IL-10, a consistent increase in adherence of HL-60 to endothelial cells is observed. This adherence was found to be mediated by L-selectin. PCR analysis and the quantification of E-selectin cDNA by a novel, highly sensitive and specific PCR-immunoassay demonstrate the induction of E-selectin mRNA at the transcriptional level.

In the course of the Workshop discussions, based both on the submitted cases and the combined experience of the participants, it was possible to agree on several distinctive categories of PTLD. These include (1) early lesions, (2) polymorphic posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs), (3) monomorphic PTLDs (B- and T-cell lymphomas), (4) plasmacytoma-like lesions, and (5) T-cell-rich large B-cell lymphoma/Hodgkin's disease-like lesions. Monomorphic lesions should be classified according to a recognized classification of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, although specified in the report as PTLD. Polymorphic lesions should be carefully evaluated for clonality; by immunophenotyping; and, if necessary, analysis of antigen-receptor and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes. Minimal pathological evaluation should include routine morphology, immunophenotyping on fresh tissue (flow cytometry or frozen section), and preservation of tissue for molecular genetic analysis. Analysis of the presence of EBV can be useful in establishing whether early or equivocal lesions represent PTLD (EBV+) or unrelated processes, but is not required in most cases. The pathologist can make an important contribution to the management of patients with PTLD by providing a complete diagnostic evaluation of the biopsy specimens (this is the least expensive part of the care of a transplant patients, not a place to try to cut costs) and making sure the attending physicians understand the special issues in management of PTLD.", "pubmed": "9044505"}, {"title": "Role of gemistocytes in astrocytoma progression.", "abstract": "The presence of gemistocytes in low-grade astrocytomas is regarded as a sign of poor prognosis because the majority of gemistocytic astrocytomas rapidly progress to anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma. To elucidate the role of gemistocytes in astrocytoma progression, we assessed the fraction of neoplastic gemistocytes, bcl-2 expression, p53 mutations, p53 immunoreactivity (PAb 1801), and proliferative activity (MIB-1) in 40 low-grade astrocytomas (World Health Organization (WHO) Grade II) with histologically proven progression to anaplastic astrocytoma (WHC Grade III) or glioblastoma (WHO Grade IV). Astrocytoma progression took significantly less time in patients with a low-grade astrocytoma containing more than 5% gemistocytes (35 months) than in those with lesions containing less than 5% gemistocytes (64 months; p = 0.038). All 11 astrocytomas with more than 5% gemistocytes contained a p53 mutation, whereas the incidence of p53 mutations in astrocytomas with less than 5% gemistocytes was 61% (p = 0.017). In low-grade astrocytomas the p53 labeling index (LI) of gemistocytes (7.4%) was significantly higher than in all tumor cells (3.2%, p = 0.0014). Gemistocytes showed a significantly higher bcl-2 expression than all tumor cells, with a mean bcl-2 1 of 15.6% versus 2.7% in low-grade astrocytomas (p = 0.0004), 20.9% versus 3.0% in anaplastic astrocytoma (p = 0.002), and 30.2% versus 5.2% in glioblastomas (p = 0.0002).

These data show that low-grade astrocytomas with a significant fraction of gemistocytes progress more rapidly and typically carry a p53 mutation. The vast majority of gemistocytes are, however, in a nonproliferative state (G0 phase of the cell cycle), which suggests terminal differentiation.

Contrary to normal senescing cells, those of most immortal or transformed cell lines are karyotypically unstable and permissive for amplification. Permissivity for amplification can be generated by gene products of several DNA tumor viruses whereby their interaction with the tumorsuppressor protein p53 is important. p53 is the major protein involved in check point control of DNA damage. Polyomavirus large T antigen is also involved in immortalization and transformation of cells but it does not interact with p53. We, therefore, examined whether this protein could still make the non-permissive cell line REF52 permissive for gene amplification. To this end REF52 cell lines were constructed which conditionally expressed the wild type polyomavirus large T antigen or a mutant form unable to bind the retinoblastoma protein. Using the inhibitor of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, phosphonoacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA), as selective agent we found that PALA resistant cells arise with a frequency of about 5 x 10(-5) and that the interaction of polyomavirus large T protein with the retinoblastoma protein or another related pocket protein is important for this to occur. PALA resistant cells have an increased number of chromosomes and dicentric chromosomes which are considered as starting point for DNA structures characteristic for amplified DNA. Such structures were indeed found with the help of fluorescence in situ hybridization. PALA resistant cells appear normal with respect to p53. Our data indicate that PALA induces a G1 block which can be partially overcome by polyomavirus large T protein by its interaction with E2F-pocket protein complexes providing further evidence that these complexes are downstream targets of p53.", "pubmed": "9050998"}, {"title": "Role of thymic selection in the development of thymic lymphomas in TCR transgenic mice.", "abstract": "To investigate the role of antigen receptor-mediated interactions in lymphomagenesis we have analyzed the influence of alpha beta TCR-mediated selection on the development of spontaneous thymic lymphomas, which appear with a high (up to 50%) frequency in mice expressing a transgenic TCR specific for the male antigen (HY) in the context of H-2Db molecules. To this end we compared the kinetics and the incidence of thymic lymphomas developing in females and males with selecting (H-2b) and non-selecting (H-2k) MHC molecules. The kinetics of development of thymic lymphomas was similar in positively selecting (H-2b females) and non-selecting (H-2k females and males) environments but significantly slower (P < 0.01) in the negatively selecting environment (H-2b male). Injection of lymphoma cells derived from a H-2b female into the thymus of a H-2b male resulted in strong, antigen-specific inhibition of growth, indicating that the slower kinetics of lymphomagenesis in H-2b males could be due, at least partially, to the sensitivity of oncogenically transformed thymocytes to TCR-mediated negative selection. Phenotypic and functional analysis of lymphoma cells indicated that they originated from the stage of pre-TCR-dependent transition of immature CD4-CD8- to CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes, which in H-2b females and males developed into tumors under different environmental pressures. These results failed to provide convincing evidence for the role of positive selection but provided a strong indication that self antigen-induced negative selection, in addition to its well established role in self tolerance, can occasionally act as a tumor surveillance mechanism by eliminating or suppressing growth of thymocytes undergoing oncogenic transformation.", "pubmed": "9043954"}, {"title": "Activated lymphoid cells in human gliomas: morphofunctional and cytochemical evidence.", "abstract": "To study defensive infiltrating cells, smear preparation from 20 fresh gliomas and autologous normal peritumoural brain tissue, used as control, were analysed.

Normal p53 function is critical for the maintenance of genomic stability. The mouse lymphoma L5178Y/TK(+/-)-3.7.2C cell line is widely used in genetic toxicology for mutagenesis and clastogenesis testing. A related line L5178Y-R, has previously been shown to react with antibodies specific for mutant as well as wild-type p53 protein and to exhibit delayed cell death after radiation. For this reason, as well as the mouse lymphoma assay's reputation for high sensitivity of detection for genotoxic agents but low specificity, we examined several clones of L5178Y cells for mutations in the conserved core domain (exons 5-8) of the p53 gene. Using single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis, we found evidence for the same mutation in exon 5 of p53 in L5178Y-R, L5178Y-S and L5178Y/TK(+/+)-3.7.2C cells. The mutation was identified by sequencing of exon 5 as a TGC (Cys) to CGC (Arg) transition in codon 170 (= codon 176 in humans). Sequencing showed approximately equivalent signals for the mutant and normal alleles for all 3 lines. The mutation in codon 170 is adjacent to a mutation hotspot of the human p53 gene (codon 175) and eliminates a critical zinc-coordinating cysteine residue such that the mutant protein is likely to be denatured and have a dominant negative effect on normal p53 function. Western blots showed approximately 100-fold higher levels of p53 protein in unirradiated L5178Y cells as compared to induced levels of p53 in normal mouse splenocytes 4 h after 5 Gy of gamma radiation. The high levels of p53 protein in L5178Y cells were not further inducible by radiation, whereas an 11-fold induction was seen in the irradiated splenocytes. These results indicate that p53 protein in L5178Y cells is dysfunctional and suggest that this line may therefore be abnormally susceptible to the induction of genetic alterations.", "pubmed": "9042396"}, {"title": "Outcome for patients with leukemia, multiple myeloma and lymphoma who relapse after high dose therapy and autologous stem cell support.", "abstract": "Relapses after autologous transplantation are a serious clinical problem in patients with haematological diseases.

So far 6 of 14 patients in continuous complete remission have a remission time after relapse longer than the time in remission after transplantation.

Y. R., Weinstein, B. M., Detrich, H. W., Zon, L. I. and Fishman, M. C. (1995). Development 121, 3141-3150). The most striking vascular phenotype is the absence of endocardial cells from the heart. Microscopic examination of mutant embryos reveals the presence of endothelial-like cells in the lower trunk and tail regions while head vessels appear to be missing, indicating a molecular diversification of the endothelial lineage. Cell transplantation experiments show that cloche acts cell-autonomously within the endothelial lineage. To analyze further the role of cloche in regulating endothelial cell differentiation, we have examined the expression of flk-1 and tie, two receptor tyrosine kinase genes expressed early and sequentially in the endothelial lineage. In wild-type fish, flk-1-positive cells are found throughout the embryo and differentiate to form the nascent vasculature. In cloche mutants, flk-1-positive cells are found only in the lower trunk and tail regions, and this expression is delayed as compared to wild-type. Unlike the flk-1-positive cells in wild-type embryos, those in cloche mutants do not go on to express tie, suggesting that their differentiation is halted at an early stage. We also find that the cloche mutation is not linked to flk-1. These data indicate that cloche affects the differentiation of all endothelial cells and that it acts at a very early stage, either by directly regulating flk-1 expression or by controlling the differentiation of cells that normally develop to express flk-1. cloche mutants also have a blood deficit and their hematopoietic tissues show no expression of the hematopoietic transcription factor genes GATA-1 or GATA-2 at early stages. Because the appearance of distinct levels of flk-1 expression is delayed in cloche mutants, we examined GATA-1 expression at late embryonic stages and found some blood cell differentiation that appears to be limited to the region lined by the flk-1-expressing cells. The spatial restriction of blood in the ventroposterior-most region of cloche mutant embryos may be indicative of a ventral source of signal(s) controlling hematopoietic differentiation.

The aim of this study was to characterize the pattern of CD40 expression in an in vitro model constituted by AIDS small non-cleaved lymphoma (SNCCL) cell lines. The analysis of CD45 isoforms, a group of molecules alternatively spliced during B cell differentiation, has been chosen to correlate this process to the number of CD40 molecules per cell in these cell lines. Since Apo 1/Fas expression is upregulated on B lymphocytes after CD40 ligation and this expression is functionally relevant, we wanted to know whether a different CD40 pattern in AIDS-SNCCL cell lines could influence CD95 expression. We have shown that 3 of these cell lines (PA 682, Es III, and HBL-2) have high membrane CD40 expression (> 100,000 molecules/cell); they release large amounts of soluble CD40 (sCD40) in culture supernatants (>500 pg/ml), are CD45RA/RO double labelled, and express the Apo 1/Fas (CD95) antigen. On the contrary, low CD40 membrane antigen cell lines (BRGIgA, HBL-2, NC 71, AS 283A, and LAM C3+, < 50,000 molecules/cell) release low amounts of sCD40 (<300 pg/ml), are CD45RA+ but CD45RO-, and do not express CD95. EBV has no role in CD40 and CD45 isoform behaviour, because EBV superinfection of the EBV negative, low membrane CD40 HBL-2 cell line does not modify CD40 membrane expression, sCD40 production, or CD45 isoform and CD95 expression. Our data suggest that membrane CD40 in AIDS-SNCCL cell lines might be a key element in the regulation of their pathophysiology by influencing the expression of CD45 isoforms and of CD95, and by the release of its soluble form.", "pubmed": "9056740"}, {"title": "Inhibition of proliferation and expression of T-antigen in SV40 large T-antigen gene-induced immortalized cells following transplantations.", "abstract": "Rat dopamine-producing nerve cells (1RB3AN27) and rat parotid acinar cells (2RSG) were immortalized by insertion of simian virus 40 (SV40) large T-antigen gene (LTa).

We studied the frequency of p53 immunoreactivity and gene alteration in 21 children with malignant astrocytomas (anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme) and analysed the survival of patients with p53 immunoreactive versus non-reactive tumors. Of the cases examined, 8 were anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and 13 were glioblastoma multiforme (GM).

To consider the impact of published data on immunophenotyping hairy-cell leukaemias, a total of 50 diagnostic biopsies were systematically analysed with a panel of eight antibodies and compared with cases of chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL), 20 follicular centre lymphomas, 20 lympho-plasmacytoid immunocytomas, 10 small-cell T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and 20 cases of benign nodular lymphatic hyperplasia. The panel of eight antibodies comprised DBA44, CD45, CD20, CD45R, CD45RO, CD43 and the CD68 antibodies KP1 and Ki-M1P. The hairy-cell leukaemias were staged histologically into four categories of bone marrow infiltration. DBA44 reacted positively in 47/50 cases. CD45 and the B-cell markers CD20 and CD45R reacted in 49/50 and 43/50 cases, respectively. One CD68 marker, KP1, was positive in 38/50 cases but the other-Ki-M1P-only in 1/50 cases. Chronic lymphatic leukaemia cases, the other B-cell NHLs and lymphatic hyperplasias showed strong positivity for CD20 and CD45R, but only the immunocytomas reacted with DBA44 in 7/20 cases. The T-cell NHLs and hyperplasias showed a strong positivity for the T-cell markers CD45RO and CD43. The CD68-marker Ki-M1P revealed a high specificity since it was negative in all NHLs and positive only in one hairy-cell leukaemia. Methyl-methacrylate embedding of bone marrow biopsies under cold polymerization produces a high quality of histo- and cytomorphology, resulting in greater diagnostic reliability and the detection of low-stage infiltration of hairy-cell leukaemia. DBA44 appears as a highly specific antibody to mark hairy-cells since only immunocytomas reacted positively in a few cases. A small panel of antibodies including DBA44.

Furthermore, several drugs of this class of compounds are valuable in the treatment of certain forms of skin disorders and cancer. However, the therapeutic application of retinoids is limited by their teratogenic potency. The limbs are important sites of retinoid-induced malformations in rodents. Therefore, organoid cultures of limb bud mesenchymal cells have been established for screening of the teratogenic potency of retinoids. We have now applied this system to compare the effects of all-trans-retinoyl-beta-D-glucuronide (all-trans-RAG) with those of all-trans-retinoic acid (all-trans-RA) on chondrogenesis, as assessed by the Alcian blue binding assay and by electron microscopic evaluation including quantitative morphometric analysis. First data of retinoid toxicokinetics in the culture media as well as retinoid concentrations in the cultured mesenchymal limb bud cells were established. While all-trans-RA inhibited chondrogenesis at 10(-7) M by ca. 50%, tenfold higher concentrations of all-trans-RAG were necessary to obtain the same effect. This difference reflects the ratio of RA isomers which were found in the medium after incubation with either all-trans-RAG or all-trans-RA. A pulse experiment (10(-5) M all-trans-RAG or all-trans-RA for the first 2 h of a 6-day incubation period) demonstrated inhibition of chondrogenesis with all-trans-RA, but not with all-trans-RAG. The data indicate that RAG inhibits chondrogenesis upon hydrolysis to RA. Surprisingly, the rather polar RAG isoforms were extensively accumulated in the limb bud mesenchymal cells when compared to the medium. Both all-trans-RAG and all-trans-RA also induced a large increase of retinyl ester concentrations in the chondrocytes compared to vehicle-treated cells. This finding further supports a recent suggestion that RA regulates retinol metabolism via feedback inhibition of retinol oxidation and stimulation of the esterification of retinol.", "pubmed": "9049050"}, {"title": "Prevalence of Epstein-Barr viral sequences and EBV LMP1 oncogene deletions in Burkitt's lymphoma from Pakistan: epidemiological correlations.", "abstract": "To investigate the potential relationship of socioeconomic status with the prevalence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and to understand the significance of del-LMP-1 within EBV+ cases of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), we studied 10 cases of BL, 30 cases of diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) arising in nonimmunocompromised patients, and 30 reactive tonsillar biopsy specimens from Pakistan. Each lymphoma was analyzed for EBV by EBER1 RNA in situ hybridization (EBV-RISH). Cases showing hybridization signal within neoplastic cells and all reactive tonsillar tissues were analyzed for EBV strain type by EBNA-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for the presence of a del-LMP-1 by PCR. Eight of 10 (80%) of BL were EBV+, each containing EBV strain A and a wild-type LMP-1 gene.

Fifteen of 30 tonsillar biopsy specimens contained EBV, all of which were strain A and wild-type for LMP1. The prevalence of EBV in BL from Pakistan is slightly lower than in BL in endemic regions, but significantly higher than in BL in North America. EBV positivity probably reflects the socioeconomic status of the patient population and age at seroconversion. The absence of del-LMP-1 within all EBV+ BL cases is consistent with the view that del-LMP-1 is not involved in the pathogenesis of BL, and the presence of del-LMP-1 in EBV+ cases of BL reported in other studies may likely reflect the prevalence of a viral strain containing the 30-bp deletion within the respective population studied.", "pubmed": "9042791"}, {"title": "Sperm quality in Hodgkin's disease versus non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.", "abstract": "The study was conducted to determine the deleterious effect of lymphoma disease on spermatogenesis and to evaluate the possibility that the disease is mediated primarily by inherent mechanisms in Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients.

Ionic currents were recorded using the patch-clamp technique, cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was monitored using the fluorescent indicator, fura-2, and GnRH secretion was measured by radioimmunoassay. In cell-attached and inside-out patch-clamp recordings, K+ channels with a single-channel conductance of approximately 200 pS were detected. Depolarizing the patch increased the unitary current size and the open probability. In perforated-patch recordings, depolarizing pulses (50 ms) to potentials of -10 to +60 mV from a holding potential of -90 mV elicited outward current with early transient and sustained components. The transient current peaked 2-10 ms after the beginning of each pulse and increased in a voltage-dependent manner. This current was: (1) unaffected by the small-conductance Ca2+ -activated K+ channel blocker, apamin (100 nM); (2) reduced by the BK channel blocker, charybdotoxin (5 nM); (3) abolished by the Ca2+ channel blocker, CdCl2 (25 mu M), and (4) prolonged by the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin (1 mu M). Based on the single-channel and whole-cell conductances, the number of channels per patch, the patch area, and the surface area of the cell, each GT1-7 cell contains 30-60 BK channels. The functional role of BK channels in GT1-7 cells was evaluated by measuring the effect of charybdotoxin (100 nM) on basal [Ca2+]i and GnRH secretion, as well as on the [Ca2+]i and GnRH secretory responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA, 100 mu M), an excitatory neurotransmitter in this system. Charybdotoxin had no effect on basal [Ca2+]i or GnRH secretion, or on the GABA-evoked [Ca2+]i and GnRH secretory responses.

The PCR product was gel-purified and subcloned into a Puc vector and the insert was sequenced on both strands, revealing several differences relative to the published sequence: S19N, S69N, D129E and R165Q.

The Bip mRNA induction is suppressed when the NGF-deprivation-dependent cell death of PC12 (22a) cells is inhibited by cAMP, cycloheximide or high K+. The Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, caused neuronal cell death accompanied by up-regulation of Bip, HSP90, and HSP70 mRNAs. In addition, a chelator of intracellular Ca2+ (BAPTA) elevated Bip mRNA and induced cell death in a low Ca2+ medium. Alterations of intracellular calcium homeostasis thus appear to induce Bip mRNA expression as well as apoptosis in PC12 (22a) cells. However, release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores by thapsigargin induced Bip mRNA expression but not cell death, indicating that Bip mRNA induction is not sufficient for neuronal death. Induction of Bip mRNA in association with apoptosis was also observed for NGF-deprived sympathetic ganglion cells in primary culture.

While TK6 was more sensitive than WI-L2-NS cells to the cytotoxic effects of X-rays, it showed fewer induced chromosome aberrations. Inhibition of apoptosis in TK6 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) resulted in X-ray-induced aberration frequencies similar in magnitude to WI-L2-NS. The results support the hypothesis that apoptosis acts to selectively remove damaged cells. The reduction in aberration frequency associated with apoptosis was seen primarily for unstable types of aberrations; acentric chromosome fragments and dicentric chromosomes.

Neither p53 expression nor mutation correlated with short survival or resistance to chemoradiotherapy, implying that p53 mutation is not a prognostic factor in NHL.", "pubmed": "9063486"}, {"title": "Autologous bone marrow versus non-mobilized peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for lymphoid malignancies: a prospective, comparative trial.", "abstract": "Autologous transplantation using bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) or peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) is widely used for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's disease (HD). We report a randomized, comparative trial comparing BMSC vs. non-mobilized PBSC for responsive NHL or HD. Patients randomized to BMSC (n = 13) vs. PBSC (n = 15) had more rapid neutrophil recovery (median 23 vs. 30 days), RBC independence (25 vs. 62 days), platelet independence (24 vs. 54 days), and shorter hospital stay. However, neither relapse, overall survival, nor relapse-free survival were different receiving BMSC vs. PBSC (all P > .7). Concurrently, 54 others (34 BMSC, 20 PBSC) were assigned non-randomly because of resistant disease or marrow unsuitable for harvest and similar patterns of engraftment favoring BMSC over PBSC were observed. In the entire group, BMSC transplantation (n = 47) led to quicker neutrophil recovery (P = .02), RBC (P = .06), and platelet independence (P =.04) and earlier hospital discharge (P = .02) vs. PBSC (n = 35). No difference in relapse, overall, or relapse-free survival were observed using BMSC vs. PBSC. These data suggest that non-mobilized PBSC are a satisfactory alternative to BMSC in patients with unsuitable marrow; however, transplantation with non-mobilized PBSC was associated with slower hematologic recovery, and longer hospital stay. No difference in tumor recurrence rates was observed between the PBSC or BMSC recipients. Unprimed PBSC transplantation offered no clinical advantage to BMSC.", "pubmed": "9067498"}, {"title": "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: new insights from murine Pig-a-deficient hematopoiesis.", "abstract": "A large fraction of the hematopoietic cells of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) are deficient in membrane expression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs). Current evidence suggests that this deficiency is sufficient to account for the hemolytic and thrombotic manifestations of this disease but not for its frequent association with aplastic anemia, an autoimmune disorder in which the patients' own hematopoietic progenitor cells are the target. Mutations in X-linked gene PIG-A, encoding one of several enzymes required for the biosynthesis of the glycophosphatidylinositol anchor, have been found in all PNH patients studied to date. Recent experiments with murine Pig-a knock-out embryonic stem cells show that although embryogenesis is critically dependent on normal GPI-AP expression, Pig-a-deficient cells can undergo apparently normal hematopoietic differentiation if they develop in a GPI-AP-replete environment. Thus, in an in vitro mouse model of PNH, Pig-a mutations confer no gross proliferative or differentiative advantage or disadvantage, suggesting an unidentified process selecting for these mutations in the bone marrow of patients with the PNH-aplastic anemia syndrome. The rescue of hematopoiesis observed in chimeric cultures of knock-out and normal cells was accompanied by intercellular transfer of GPI-AP, suggesting exciting new possibilities for future therapeutic manipulations in PNH patients.", "pubmed": "9069578"}, {"title": "Functional mitral stenosis resulting from a large mitral valve prosthesis vegetation.", "abstract": "Obstruction of a prosthetic valve by an infective vegetation is a rare and life-threatening complication of endocarditis that demands emergent surgical intervention. In our patient's case, transthoracic echocardiography showed the large vegetation, transthoracic Doppler imaging showed severe obstruction of diastolic flow through the bioprosthetic valve, and transesophageal echocardiography showed that no perivalvular abscess was present.

The cervix was softened and dilated by inserting a laminaria tent the night before the operation. During the procedure a 7-mm resectoscope was first used to cut the pedicle to a size smaller than 10 mm. A sessile myoma was resected into a pedunculated myoma, and its body resected with a 9-mm resectoscope. The smaller portions were removed with a pair of forceps. Simultaneous ultrasonography was used to monitor the procedure. Specimen weights ranged from 50 to 145 g (mean 78.5 g). The operation time was 13 to 118 minutes (mean 49 min). No complications were encountered, other than a cervical laceration caused by forceps. Postoperatively, 22 patients had improvement of menorrhagia and anemia. Three women underwent the same procedure due to recurrence of the fibroid; two had full-term deliveries. Our method has proved to be safe and efficient for treatment of a sessile or large submucous fibroid.", "pubmed": "9050497"}]
